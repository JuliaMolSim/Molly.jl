- dQdR calculation in charge interpolation never worked (GPU & CPU)
- Parallelize charge interpolation on CPU
- remove repeated allocations for things in force loop
- figure out how to adapt run! function to Molly
- add LongRangeInteraction type?, SPME is a pair interaction though
- write kernel to calculate the scaled fractional coords for charge interpolation on GPU

- put the reciprocal space code into a function
    - bundle this into a package extension? would separate FFTW and potentially Adapt.jl

- do particle-particle part with Molly existing infastructure
