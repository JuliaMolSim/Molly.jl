"""
A general interaction that will apply to all atom pairs.
Custom general interactions should sub-type this type.

A specific interaction between sets of specific atoms, e.g. a bond angle.
Custom specific interactions should sub-type this type.

"""
A general type of cutoff encoding the approximation used for a potential.
Interactions can be parametrized by the cutoff behavior.

    Atom(; <keyword arguments>)

An atom and its associated information.
Properties unused in the simulation or in analysis can be left with their
default values.
This type cannot be used on the GPU as it is not `isbits` - use `AtomMin` instead.

# Arguments
- `attype::AbstractString=""`: the type of the atom.
- `name::AbstractString=""`: the name of the atom.
- `resnum::Integer=0`: the residue number if the atom is part of a polymer.
- `resname::AbstractString=""`: the residue name if the atom is part of a
    polymer.
- `charge::T=0.0`: the charge of the atom, used for electrostatic interactions.
- `mass::T=0.0`: the mass of the atom.
- `σ::T=0.0`: the Lennard-Jones finite distance at which the inter-particle
    potential is zero.
- `ϵ::T=0.0`: the Lennard-Jones depth of the potential well.

    AtomMin(; <keyword arguments>)

An atom and minimal information required for simulation.
Properties unused in the simulation or in analysis can be left with their
default values.
This type is `isbits` and can be used on the GPU - use `Atom` in other contexts to store
more information.

# Arguments
- `charge::T=0.0`: the charge of the atom, used for electrostatic interactions.
- `mass::T=0.0`: the mass of the atom.
- `σ::T=0.0`: the Lennard-Jones finite distance at which the inter-particle

"""
    Simulation(; <keyword arguments>)

The data needed to define and run a molecular simulation.
Properties unused in the simulation or in analysis can be left with their
default values.

# Arguments
- `simulator::Simulator`: the type of simulation to run.
- `atoms::Vector{A}`: the atoms, or atom equivalents, in the simulation. Can be
    of any type.
- `specific_inter_lists::SI=()`: the specific interactions in the simulation,
    i.e. interactions between specific atoms such as bonds or angles. Typically
    a `Tuple`.
- `general_inters::GI=()`: the general interactions in the simulation, i.e.
    interactions between all or most atoms such as electrostatics. Typically a
    `Tuple`.
- `coords::C`: the coordinates of the atoms in the simulation. Typically a
    `Vector` of `SVector`s of any dimension and type `T`, where `T` is an
    `AbstractFloat` type.
- `velocities::C=zero(coords)`: the velocities of the atoms in the simulation,
    which should be the same type as the coordinates. The meaning of the
    velocities depends on the simulator used, e.g. for the `VelocityFreeVerlet`
    simulator they represent the previous step coordinates for the first step.
- `temperature::T=0.0`: the temperature of the simulation.
- `box_size::T`: the size of the cube in which the simulation takes place.
- `neighbour_finder::NeighbourFinder=NoNeighbourFinder()`: the neighbour finder
    used to find close atoms and save on computation.
- `thermostat::Thermostat=NoThermostat()`: the thermostat which applies during
    the simulation.
- `loggers::Dict{String, <:Logger}=Dict()`: the loggers that record properties
    of interest during the simulation.
- `timestep::T=0.0`: the timestep of the simulation.
- `n_steps::Integer=0`: the number of steps in the simulation.
- `n_steps_made::Vector{Int}=[]`: the number of steps already made during the
    simulation. This is a `Vector` to allow the `struct` to be immutable.
