# Molly documentation

This documentation will first introduce the main features of the package with some examples, then will give details on each component of a simulation.
There are further examples in the [Molly examples](@ref) section.
For more information on specific types or functions, see the [Molly API](@ref) section or call `?function_name` in Julia.
The [Differentiable simulation with Molly](@ref) section describes taking gradients through simulations.

Molly takes a modular approach to molecular simulation.
To run a simulation you create a [`System`](@ref) object and call [`simulate!`](@ref) on it.
The different components of the system and simulation can be used as defined by the package, or you can define your own versions.
An important principle of the package is that your custom components, particularly force functions, should be easy to define and just as performant as the built-in versions.

## Simulation basics

Let's look at the simulation of a fluid acting under the [Lennard-Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential) potential to start with.
First, we'll need some atoms with the relevant parameters defined.
```julia
using Molly

n_atoms = 100
atom_mass = 10.0u"u"
atoms = [Atom(mass=atom_mass, σ=0.3u"nm", ϵ=0.2u"kJ * mol^-1") for i in 1:n_atoms]
```
See the [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl) docs for more information on the unit annotations.
Molly re-exports Unitful.jl, [StaticArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl) and [AtomsBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl) since they are often required to run simulations.
You can use your own atom types in Molly, provided that the [`mass`](@ref) function is defined and any fields required by the interactions are present.
Next, we'll need some starting coordinates and velocities.
```julia
boundary = CubicBoundary(2.0u"nm", 2.0u"nm", 2.0u"nm") # Periodic boundary conditions
coords = place_atoms(n_atoms, boundary, 0.3u"nm") # Random placement without clashing

temp = 100.0u"K"
velocities = [velocity(atom_mass, temp) for i in 1:n_atoms]
```
We store the coordinates and velocities as [static arrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl) for performance.
They can be of 2 or 3 dimensions and of any number type, e.g. `Float64` or `Float32`.
Setting individual dimensions in a [`CubicBoundary`](@ref) to `Inf * u"nm"` makes the simulation have no boundary in that dimension.
You can also use a [`TriclinicBoundary`](@ref).
Simulations in 2 dimensions should use a [`RectangularBoundary`](@ref).

Now we can define our pairwise interactions, i.e. those between most or all atom pairs.
Because we have defined the relevant parameters for the atoms, we can use the built-in Lennard-Jones type.
```julia
pairwise_inters = (LennardJones(),) # Don't forget the trailing comma!
```
Finally, we can define the system and run the simulation.
We use an Andersen thermostat to keep a constant temperature, and we log the temperature and coordinates every 10 steps.
Periodic boundary conditions are automatically used with the cubic box we defined earlier.
```julia
sys = System(
    atoms=atoms,
    pairwise_inters=pairwise_inters,
    coords=coords,
    velocities=velocities,
    boundary=boundary,
    loggers=(
        temp=TemperatureLogger(10),
        coords=CoordinateLogger(10),
    ),
)

simulator = VelocityVerlet(
    dt=0.002u"ps",
    coupling=AndersenThermostat(temp, 1.0u"ps"),
)

simulate!(sys, simulator, 1_000)
```
`atoms`, `coords` and `boundary` are the minimum required properties to define a [`System`](@ref), though you would generally want to add interactions to a [`System`](@ref) to do something useful with it.

[`System`](@ref) implements the `AbstractSystem` [interface from AtomsBase.jl](https://juliamolsim.github.io/AtomsBase.jl/stable).
The functions [`masses`](@ref), [`is_gpu_diff_safe`](@ref), [`is_on_gpu`](@ref) and [`float_type`](@ref) can be used on a [`System`](@ref).

By default the simulation is run in parallel on the [number of threads](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/parallel-computing/#man-multithreading-1) available to Julia, but this behaviour can be changed by giving the keyword argument `n_threads` to [`simulate!`](@ref).
For example, `n_threads=1` uses no parallelization.

The values stored by the loggers can be accessed using `values`, e.g. `values(sys.loggers.coords)`.
An animation of the stored coordinates can be saved by using [`visualize`](@ref), which is available when [GLMakie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) is imported.
```julia
using GLMakie
visualize(sys.loggers.coords, boundary, "sim_lj.mp4")
```

## GPU acceleration

To run simulations on the GPU you will need to have a CUDA-compatible device and to have [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl) installed.
Simulation setup is similar to above, but with the coordinates, velocities and atoms moved to the GPU.
This example also shows setting up a simulation to run with `Float32`, which gives better performance on GPUs.
Of course, you will need to determine whether this level of numerical accuracy is appropriate in your case.
The GPU code path is currently designed to work with differentiable simulation and runs slower than related software, but this is an active area of development.
```julia
using Molly
using CUDA

n_atoms = 100
atom_mass = 10.0f0u"u"
boundary = CubicBoundary(2.0f0u"nm", 2.0f0u"nm", 2.0f0u"nm")
temp = 100.0f0u"K"
atoms = CuArray([Atom(mass=atom_mass, σ=0.3f0u"nm", ϵ=0.2f0u"kJ * mol^-1") for i in 1:n_atoms])
coords = CuArray(place_atoms(n_atoms, boundary; min_dist=0.3u"nm"))
velocities = CuArray([velocity(atom_mass, temp) for i in 1:n_atoms])
simulator = VelocityVerlet(dt=0.002f0u"ps")

sys = System(
    atoms=atoms,
    pairwise_inters=(LennardJones(),),
    coords=coords,
    velocities=velocities,
    boundary=boundary,
    loggers=(
        temp=TemperatureLogger(typeof(1.0f0u"K"), 10),
        coords=CoordinateLogger(typeof(1.0f0u"nm"), 10),
    ),
)

simulate!(sys, simulator, 1_000)
```

## Simulating diatomic molecules

If we want to define specific interactions between atoms, for example bonds, we can do this as well.
Using the same definitions as the first example, let's set up the coordinates so that paired atoms are 1 Å apart.
```julia
coords = place_atoms(n_atoms ÷ 2, boundary; min_dist=0.3u"nm")
for i in 1:length(coords)
    push!(coords, coords[i] .+ [0.1, 0.0, 0.0]u"nm")
end

velocities = [velocity(atom_mass, temp) for i in 1:n_atoms]
```
We could have used [`place_diatomics`](@ref) instead here.
Now we can use the built-in interaction list and bond types to place harmonic bonds between paired atoms.
```julia
bonds = InteractionList2Atoms(
    collect(1:(n_atoms ÷ 2)),           # First atom indices
    collect((1 + n_atoms ÷ 2):n_atoms), # Second atom indices
    repeat([""], n_atoms ÷ 2),          # Bond types
    [HarmonicBond(k=300_000.0u"kJ * mol^-1 * nm^-2", r0=0.1u"nm") for i in 1:(n_atoms ÷ 2)],
)

specific_inter_lists = (bonds,)
```
This time, we are also going to use a neighbor list to speed up the Lennard Jones calculation.
We can use the built-in [`DistanceNeighborFinder`](@ref).
The arguments are a 2D array of eligible interacting pairs, the number of steps between each update and the distance cutoff to be classed as a neighbor.
Since the neighbor finder is run every 10 steps we should also use a cutoff for the interaction with a cutoff distance less than the neighbor list distance.
```julia
# All pairs apart from bonded pairs are eligible for non-bonded interactions
nb_matrix = trues(n_atoms, n_atoms)
for i in 1:(n_atoms ÷ 2)
    nb_matrix[i, i + (n_atoms ÷ 2)] = false
    nb_matrix[i + (n_atoms ÷ 2), i] = false
end

neighbor_finder = DistanceNeighborFinder(
    nb_matrix=nb_matrix,
    n_steps=10,
    dist_cutoff=1.5u"nm",
)

pairwise_inters = (LennardJones(nl_only=true, cutoff=DistanceCutoff(1.2u"nm")),)
```
Now we can simulate as before.
```julia
sys = System(
    atoms=atoms,
    pairwise_inters=pairwise_inters,
    specific_inter_lists=specific_inter_lists,
    coords=coords,
    velocities=velocities,
    boundary=boundary,
    neighbor_finder=neighbor_finder,
    loggers=(
        temp=TemperatureLogger(10),
        coords=CoordinateLogger(10),
    ),
)

simulator = VelocityVerlet(
    dt=0.002u"ps",
    coupling=AndersenThermostat(temp, 1.0u"ps"),
)
simulate!(sys, simulator, 1_000)
```
This time when we view the trajectory we can add lines to show the bonds.
```julia
visualize(
    sys.loggers.coords,
    boundary,
    "sim_diatomic.mp4";
    connections=[(i, i + (n_atoms ÷ 2)) for i in 1:(n_atoms ÷ 2)],
)
```

## Simulating gravity

Molly is geared primarily to molecular simulation, but can also be used to simulate other physical systems.
Let's set up a gravitational simulation.
This example also shows the use of `Float32`, a 2D simulation and no specified units.
```julia
atoms = [Atom(mass=1.0f0), Atom(mass=1.0f0)]
coords = [SVector(0.3f0, 0.5f0), SVector(0.7f0, 0.5f0)]
velocities = [SVector(0.0f0, 1.0f0), SVector(0.0f0, -1.0f0)]
pairwise_inters = (Gravity(nl_only=false, G=1.5f0),)
simulator = VelocityVerlet(dt=0.002f0)
boundary = RectangularBoundary(1.0f0, 1.0f0)

sys = System(
    atoms=atoms,
    pairwise_inters=pairwise_inters,
    coords=coords,
    velocities=velocities,
    boundary=boundary,
    loggers=(coords=CoordinateLogger(Float32, 10; dims=2),),
    force_units=NoUnits,
    energy_units=NoUnits,
)

simulate!(sys, simulator, 2_000)
```
When we view the simulation we can use some extra options:
```julia
visualize(
    sys.loggers.coords,
    boundary,
    "sim_gravity.mp4";
    trails=4,
    framerate=15,
    color=[:orange, :lightgreen],
)
```

## Simulating a protein

The recommended way to run a macromolecular simulation is to read in a force field in [OpenMM XML format](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application/05_creating_ffs.html) and read in a coordinate file in a format [supported by Chemfiles.jl](https://chemfiles.org/chemfiles/latest/formats.html).
Files for common force fields can be found at [OpenMM](https://github.com/openmm/openmm) and [OpenMM force fields](https://github.com/openmm/openmmforcefields).
This sets up a system in the same data structures as above and that is simulated in the same way.
Here we carry out an energy minimization, simulate with a Langevin integrator and use a [`StructureWriter`](@ref) to write the trajectory as a PDB file.
```julia
data_dir = joinpath(dirname(pathof(Molly)), "..", "data")
ff = OpenMMForceField(
    joinpath(data_dir, "force_fields", "ff99SBildn.xml"),
    joinpath(data_dir, "force_fields", "tip3p_standard.xml"),
    joinpath(data_dir, "force_fields", "his.xml"),
)

sys = System(
    joinpath(data_dir, "6mrr_equil.pdb"),
    ff;
    loggers=(
        energy=TotalEnergyLogger(10),
        writer=StructureWriter(10, "traj_6mrr_1ps.pdb", ["HOH"]),
    ),
)

minimizer = SteepestDescentMinimizer()
simulate!(sys, minimizer)

random_velocities!(sys, 298.0u"K")
simulator = Langevin(
    dt=0.001u"ps",
    temperature=300.0u"K",
    friction=1.0u"ps^-1",
)

simulate!(sys, simulator, 5_000; n_threads=Threads.nthreads())
```
You can use an implicit solvent method by giving the `implicit_solvent` keyword argument to [`System`](@ref).
The options are `"obc1"`, `"obc2"` and `"gbn2"`, corresponding to the Onufriev-Bashford-Case GBSA model with parameter set I or II and the GB-Neck2 model.
Other options include overriding the boundary dimensions in the file (`boundary`) and modifying the non-bonded interaction and neighbor list cutoff distances (`dist_cutoff` and `dist_neighbors`).

Molly also has a rudimentary parser of [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org) topology and coordinate files.
```julia
sys = System(
    joinpath(dirname(pathof(Molly)), "..", "data", "5XER", "gmx_coords.gro"),
    joinpath(dirname(pathof(Molly)), "..", "data", "5XER", "gmx_top_ff.top");
    loggers=(
        temp=TemperatureLogger(10),
        writer=StructureWriter(10, "traj_5XER_1ps.pdb"),
    ),
)

temp = 298.0u"K"
random_velocities!(sys, temp)
simulator = Verlet(
    dt=0.0002u"ps",
    coupling=BerendsenThermostat(temp, 1.0u"ps"),
)

simulate!(sys, simulator, 5_000)
```
Harmonic position restraints can be added to a [`System`](@ref) for equilibration using [`add_position_restraints`](@ref):
```julia
sys_res = add_position_restraints(
    sys,
    100_000.0u"kJ * mol^-1 * nm^-2";
    atom_selector=is_heavy_atom,
)
```

The OpenMM setup procedure is tested against OpenMM in terms of matching forces and energies.
However it is not thoroughly tested with respect to ligands or special residues and requires that atom names exactly match residue templates.
The Gromacs setup procedure should be considered experimental.
Currently Ewald summation methods, constraint algorithms, pressure coupling and high GPU performance are missing from the package, so Molly is not suitable for production simulations of biomolecules.

## Enhanced sampling

Molly has the [`ReplicaSystem`](@ref) struct and simulators such as [`TemperatureREMD`](@ref) to carry out replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD).
On CPU these are run in parallel by dividing up the number of available threads.
For example to run temperature REMD on a protein with 4 replicas and attempt exchanges every 1.0 ps:
```julia
using Statistics

data_dir = joinpath(dirname(pathof(Molly)), "..", "data")
ff = OpenMMForceField(
    joinpath(data_dir, "force_fields", "ff99SBildn.xml"),
    joinpath(data_dir, "force_fields", "tip3p_standard.xml"),
    joinpath(data_dir, "force_fields", "his.xml"),
)

sys = System(joinpath(data_dir, "6mrr_equil.pdb"), ff)

minimizer = SteepestDescentMinimizer()
simulate!(sys, minimizer)

n_replicas = 4

rep_sys = ReplicaSystem(
    atoms=sys.atoms,
    atoms_data=sys.atoms_data,
    pairwise_inters=sys.pairwise_inters,
    specific_inter_lists=sys.specific_inter_lists,
    general_inters=sys.general_inters,
    n_replicas=n_replicas,
    replica_coords=[copy(sys.coords) for _ in 1:n_replicas],
    boundary=sys.boundary,
    neighbor_finder=sys.neighbor_finder,
    replica_loggers=[(temp=TemperatureLogger(10),) for _ in 1:n_replicas],
)

temps = [240.0u"K", 280.0u"K", 320.0u"K", 360.0u"K"]
dt = 0.0005u"ps"
simulators = [Langevin(dt=dt, temperature=temp, friction=1.0u"ps^-1") for temp in temps]

sim = TemperatureREMD(
    dt=dt,
    temperatures=temps,
    simulators=simulators,
    exchange_time=1.0u"ps",
)

simulate!(rep_sys, sim, 40_000; assign_velocities=true)

println(rep_sys.exchange_logger.n_attempts)
# 30

for i in 1:n_replicas
    final_temps = values(rep_sys.replicas[i].loggers.temp)[(end - 10):end]
    println(mean(final_temps))
end
# 240.1691457033836 K
# 281.3783250460198 K
# 320.44985840482974 K
# 357.710520769689 K
```

## Agent-based modelling

Agent-based modelling (ABM) is conceptually similar to molecular dynamics.
Julia has [Agents.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/) for ABM, but Molly can also be used to simulate arbitrary agent-based systems in continuous space.
Here we simulate a toy [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model) for disease spread.
This example shows how atom properties can be mutable, i.e. change during the simulation, and includes custom forces and loggers (see below for more info).
```julia
@enum Status susceptible infected recovered

# Custom atom type
mutable struct Person
    i::Int
    status::Status
    mass::Float64
    σ::Float64
    ϵ::Float64
end

# Custom PairwiseInteraction
struct SIRInteraction <: PairwiseInteraction
    nl_only::Bool
    dist_infection::Float64
    prob_infection::Float64
    prob_recovery::Float64
end

# Custom force function
function Molly.force(inter::SIRInteraction,
                        vec_ij,
                        coord_i,
                        coord_j,
                        atom_i,
                        atom_j,
                        boundary)
    if (atom_i.status == infected && atom_j.status == susceptible) ||
                (atom_i.status == susceptible && atom_j.status == infected)
        # Infect close people randomly
        r2 = sum(abs2, vec_ij)
        if r2 < inter.dist_infection^2 && rand() < inter.prob_infection
            atom_i.status = infected
            atom_j.status = infected
        end
    end
    # Workaround to obtain a self-interaction
    if atom_i.i == (atom_j.i + 1)
        # Recover randomly
        if atom_i.status == infected && rand() < inter.prob_recovery
            atom_i.status = recovered
        end
    end
    return zero(coord_i)
end

# Custom Logger
function fracs_SIR(s::System, neighbors=nothing; n_threads::Integer=Threads.nthreads())
    counts_sir = [
        count(p -> p.status == susceptible, s.atoms),
        count(p -> p.status == infected   , s.atoms),
        count(p -> p.status == recovered  , s.atoms)
    ]
    return counts_sir ./ length(s)
end

SIRLogger(n_steps) = GeneralObservableLogger(fracs_SIR, Vector{Float64}, n_steps)

temp = 1.0
boundary = RectangularBoundary(10.0, 10.0)
n_steps = 1_000
n_people = 500
n_starting = 2
atoms = [Person(i, i <= n_starting ? infected : susceptible, 1.0, 0.1, 0.02) for i in 1:n_people]
coords = place_atoms(n_people, boundary; min_dist=0.1)
velocities = [velocity(1.0, temp; dims=2) for i in 1:n_people]
pairwise_inters = (
    LennardJones=LennardJones(nl_only=true),
    SIR=SIRInteraction(false, 0.5, 0.06, 0.01),
)
neighbor_finder = DistanceNeighborFinder(
    nb_matrix=trues(n_people, n_people),
    n_steps=10,
    dist_cutoff=2.0,
)
simulator = VelocityVerlet(
    dt=0.02,
    coupling=AndersenThermostat(temp, 5.0),
)

sys = System(
    atoms=atoms,
    pairwise_inters=pairwise_inters,
    coords=coords,
    velocities=velocities,
    boundary=boundary,
    neighbor_finder=neighbor_finder,
    loggers=(
        coords=CoordinateLogger(Float64, 10; dims=2),
        SIR=SIRLogger(10),
    ),
    force_units=NoUnits,
    energy_units=NoUnits,
)

simulate!(sys, simulator, n_steps)

visualize(sys.loggers.coords, boundary, "sim_agent.mp4"; markersize=0.1)
```
![Agent simulation](images/sim_agent.gif)

We can use the logger to plot the fraction of people susceptible (blue), infected (orange) and recovered (green) over the course of the simulation:

```julia
using Plots

sir_matrix = zeros(length(values(sys.loggers.SIR)), 3)
for i = 1:101
    sir_matrix[i, :] .= values(sys.loggers.SIR)[i][:]
end

plot(sir_matrix)
```

![Fraction SIR](images/fraction_sir.png)

## Units

Molly is fairly opinionated about using [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl) units as shown above: you don't have to use them, but it is better if you do.
Whilst you occasionally may run into friction with dimension mismatches, using units has the major advantages of catching whole classes of errors and letting you physically interpret the numbers in your system.
The performance overhead of using units is minimal.
Units are not currently compatible with differentiable simulations.

All your interaction types need to return the same units of force and energy or the simulation will not run.
By default these are `kJ * mol^-1 * nm^-1` for force and `kJ * mol^-1` for energy, but this can be changed using the `force_units` and `energy_units` arguments to [`System`](@ref).
If you need to strip units for downstream analysis, use the `ustrip` function.
It should be noted that charges are stored as dimensionless, i.e. 1.0 represents an atomic charge of +1.

## Atom types

Molly has a built-in [`Atom`](@ref) type with a few properties commonly used in molecular simulation defined.
Custom atom types can be used just as well provided that either the [`mass`](@ref) function is defined on the type or the type has a `mass` field (the fallback for the [`mass`](@ref) function).
The type should also have all fields required by the interactions.
The list of atoms passed to the [`System`](@ref) constructor should be concretely typed.

Custom atom types should generally be bits types, i.e. `isbitstype(MyAtom)` should be `true`, to work on the GPU.
Additional non-bits type data for the atoms that is not directly used when calculating the interactions can be passed to the [`System`](@ref) constructor with the `atoms_data` keyword argument.
For example the built-in [`AtomData`](@ref) type contains fields that are useful when writing trajectories such as the atom name.

## Forces and energies

Interactions define how different parts of the system interact.
The force on each particle in the system is derived from the potential corresponding to the interaction.
```math
\vec{F}_i = -\sum_j \frac{dV_{ij}(r_{ij})}{dr_{ij}}\frac{\vec{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}}
```

In Molly there are three types of interactions:
- [`PairwiseInteraction`](@ref)s are present between all or most atom pairs, and account for example for non-bonded terms in molecular mechanics force fields.
- [`SpecificInteraction`](@ref)s are present between specific atoms, and account for example for bonded terms in molecular mechanics force fields.
- General interactions are a free-form interaction type that can access the whole system and outputs forces for all atoms. This is useful for neural network potentials, implicit solvent models and other cases that require maximum flexibility.

The available pairwise interactions are:
- [`LennardJones`](@ref)
- [`LennardJonesSoftCore`](@ref)
- [`SoftSphere`](@ref)
- [`Mie`](@ref)
- [`Coulomb`](@ref)
- [`CoulombSoftCore`](@ref)
- [`CoulombReactionField`](@ref)
- [`Gravity`](@ref)

The available specific interactions are:
- [`HarmonicPositionRestraint`](@ref) - 1 atom
- [`HarmonicBond`](@ref) - 2 atoms
- [`MorseBond`](@ref) - 2 atoms
- [`FENEBond`](@ref) - 2 atoms
- [`HarmonicAngle`](@ref) - 3 atoms
- [`CosineAngle`](@ref) - 3 atoms
- [`PeriodicTorsion`](@ref) - 4 atoms
- [`RBTorsion`](@ref) - 4 atoms

The available general interactions are:
- [`ImplicitSolventOBC`](@ref)
- [`ImplicitSolventGBN2`](@ref)

### Pairwise interactions

To define your own [`PairwiseInteraction`](@ref), first define the `struct`:
```julia
struct MyPairwiseInter <: PairwiseInteraction
    nl_only::Bool
    # Any other properties, e.g. constants for the interaction or cutoff parameters
end
```
The `nl_only` property is required and determines whether the neighbor list is used to omit distant atoms (`true`) or whether all atom pairs are always considered (`false`).
To work on the GPU the `struct` should be a bits type, i.e. `isbitstype(MyPairwiseInter)` should be `true`.

Next, you need to define the [`force`](@ref) function acting between a pair of atoms.
This has a set series of arguments.
For example:
```julia
function Molly.force(inter::MyPairwiseInter,
                        vec_ij,
                        coord_i,
                        coord_j,
                        atom_i,
                        atom_j,
                        boundary)
    # Replace this with your force calculation
    # A positive force causes the atoms to move apart
    f = 0.0

    # Obtain a vector for the force
    fdr = f * normalize(vec_ij)
    return fdr
end
```
`vec_ij` is the vector between the closest images of atoms `i` and `j` accounting for the periodic boundary conditions.
Atom properties can be accessed, e.g. `atom_i.σ`.
Typically the force function is where most computation time is spent during the simulation, so consider optimising this function if you want high performance.
An optional final argument `weight_14` is a `Bool` determining whether the atom pair is in a 1-4 bonding arrangement (i-x-x-j).
When simulating molecules, non-bonded interactions for these pairs are often weighted by a factor such as 0.5.
For interactions where this is relevant, `weight_14` can be used to apply this weighting in the interaction.

To use your custom force in a simulation, add it to the list of pairwise interactions:
```julia
pairwise_inters = (MyPairwiseInter(true),)
```
Then create a [`System`](@ref) and simulate as above.
Note that you can also use named tuples instead of tuples if you want to access interactions by name:
```julia
pairwise_inters = (MyPairwiseInter=MyPairwiseInter(true),)
```
For performance reasons it is best to [avoid containers with abstract type parameters](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#man-performance-abstract-container-1), such as `Vector{PairwiseInteraction}`.

If you wish to calculate potential energies or log the energy throughout a simulation, define the [`potential_energy`](@ref) function.
This has the same arguments as [`force`](@ref) and should return a single value corresponding to the potential energy.

### Specific interactions

To define your own [`SpecificInteraction`](@ref), first define the `struct`:
```julia
struct MySpecificInter <: SpecificInteraction
    # Properties, e.g. a bond distance corresponding to the energy minimum
end
```
Next, you need to define the [`force`](@ref) function.
The form of this will depend whether the interaction involves 1, 2, 3 or 4 atoms.
For example in the 2 atom case:
```julia
function Molly.force(inter::MySpecificInter, coords_i, coords_j, boundary)
    dr = vector(coords_i, coords_j, boundary)

    # Replace this with your force calculation
    # A positive force causes the atoms to move apart
    f = 0.0

    fdr = f * normalize(dr)
    return SpecificForce2Atoms(-fdr, fdr)
end
```
The 3 atom case would define `Molly.force(inter::MySpecificInter, coords_i, coords_j, coords_k, boundary)` and return `SpecificForce3Atoms(f1, f2, f3)`.
To use your custom force, add it to the specific interaction lists along with the atom indices:
```julia
specific_inter_lists = (
    InteractionList2Atoms(
        [1, 3],
        [2, 4],
        ["", ""],
        [MySpecificInter(), MySpecificInter()],
    ),
)
```
For 3 atom interactions use [`InteractionList3Atoms`](@ref) and pass 3 sets of indices.
If using the GPU, the inner list of interactions should be moved to the GPU.
The number in the interaction list and the return type from [`force`](@ref) must match, e.g. [`InteractionList3Atoms`](@ref) must always return [`SpecificForce3Atoms`](@ref) from the corresponding [`force`](@ref) function.
If some atoms are required in the interaction for force calculation but have no force applied to them by the interaction, give a zero force vector for those atoms.
Again a [`potential_energy`](@ref) function with the same arguments can be defined.

### General interactions

To define your own general interaction, first define the `struct`:
```julia
struct MyGeneralInter
    # Properties, e.g. a neural network model
end
```
Next, you need to define the [`forces`](@ref) function (note this is different to the [`force`](@ref) function above).
```julia
function Molly.forces(inter::MyGeneralInter, sys, neighbors=nothing)
    # Calculate the forces on all atoms using the interaction and the system
    # The output should have the same shape as the coordinates
    # For example, a neural network might do something like this
    return inter.model(sys.coords, sys.atoms)
end
```
The neighbors calculated from the neighbor list are available in this function, but may or may not be used depending on context.
You could carry out your own neighbor finding in this function if required.
Note that this function calculates forces not accelerations; if you have a neural network that calculates accelerations you should multiply these by `masses(sys)` to get the forces according to F=ma.
A [`potential_energy`](@ref) function that takes the same arguments and returns a single value can also be defined.
To use your custom force in a simulation, add it to the list of general interactions:
```julia
general_inters = (MyGeneralInter(),)
```
`general_inters=general_inters` can be given as a keyword argument when setting up the [`System`](@ref).

## Cutoffs

The total potential energy of a system is given as a sum of the individual inter-particle potentials
```math
V(\vec{r}_1, \dotsc, \vec{r}_N) = \sum_{i<j}V_{ij}(r_{ij})
```

The forces acting on the particles are given by
```math
\vec{F}_i = -\sum_j \frac{dV_{ij}(r_{ij})}{dr_{ij}}\frac{\vec{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}}
```

In the case of the Lennard-Jones potential, the inter-particle potential is given by
```math
V_{ij}(r_{ij}) = 4\varepsilon_{ij} \left[\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\right)^{6}\right]
```
and the forces are given by
```math
\begin{aligned}
\vec{F}_i &= 24\varepsilon_{ij} \left(2\frac{\sigma_{ij}^{12}}{r_{ij}^{13}} - \frac{\sigma_{ij}^6}{r_{ij}^{7}}\right) \frac{\vec{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}} \\
&= \frac{24\varepsilon_{ij}}{r_{ij}^2} \left[2\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}^{6}}{r_{ij}^{6}}\right)^2 -\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\right)^{6}\right] \vec{r}_{ij}
\end{aligned}
```

As the potential, and thus also the force decreases rapidly with the distance, in almost every implementation of the Lennard-Jones force calculation there is a cutoff radius beyond which the force is set to 0.

While this is often a sensible approach, it introduces a discontinuity in the force function and it requires us to also modify the potential, as beyond the cutoff radius the force would be 0, but the derivative of the unmodified potential is not. One way to truncate the potential is to shift the potential by its cutoff value.
```math
\begin{aligned}
\vec{F}_{SP}(\vec{r}) &= \begin{cases}
\vec{F}(\vec{r}), r < r_c \\
0, r > r_c
\end{cases} \\
V_{SP}(r) &= \begin{cases}
V(r) - V(r_c), r \le r_c \\
0, r > r_c
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
```

This way the potential function is continuous and the relation between forces and potentials is satisfied. This truncation method is called shifted potential cutoff.

Another option is to shift the force in order to make it continuous
```math
\begin{aligned}
F_{SF}(r) &= \begin{cases}
F(r) - F(r_c), r \le r_c \\
0, r > r_c
\end{cases} \\
V_{SF}(r) &= \begin{cases}
V(r) - (r-r_c) V'(r_c) - V(r_c), r \le r_c \\
0, r > r_c
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
```
This requires a more complicated change in the potential in order to satisfy the relation between them. This method is called the shifted force cutoff. The continuity of the force is desirable as it may give better energy conservation properties as shown in [Toxvaerd 2011](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3558787).

There are also more complicated truncation methods that interpolate between the original potential and 0, but we will consider those two for the moment.

The truncation approximations that we use can significantly alter the qualitative features of the simulation as shown in many articles in the molecular dynamics literature ([Fitzner 2017](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4997698), [van der Spoel 2006](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct0502256) and others).

Since the truncation algorithm is independent of the interaction for which is used, each compatible interaction is defined without including cutoffs.
The corresponding interaction constructor has a `cutoff` field (default [`NoCutoff`](@ref)) which is then used via dispatch to apply the chosen cutoff, e.g. `SoftSphere(cutoff=ShiftedPotentialCutoff(1.2u"nm"))`.
The available cutoffs are:
- [`NoCutoff`](@ref)
- [`DistanceCutoff`](@ref)
- [`ShiftedPotentialCutoff`](@ref)
- [`ShiftedForceCutoff`](@ref)
- [`CubicSplineCutoff`](@ref)

The following interactions can use a cutoff:
- [`LennardJones`](@ref)
- [`LennardJonesSoftCore`](@ref)
- [`SoftSphere`](@ref)
- [`Mie`](@ref)
- [`Coulomb`](@ref)
- [`CoulombSoftCore`](@ref)
In addition, [`CoulombReactionField`](@ref) and the implicit solvent models have a `dist_cutoff` argument for a cutoff distance.

## Boundaries

Molly allows the use of various periodic and infinite boundary conditions.
The available 3D boundaries are:
- [`CubicBoundary`](@ref)
- [`TriclinicBoundary`](@ref)

The available 2D boundaries are:
- [`RectangularBoundary`](@ref)

Some examples of using boundaries:
```julia
CubicBoundary(2.0u"nm"   , 2.0u"nm"   , 2.0u"nm"   ) # Periodic cube with 2 nm sides
CubicBoundary(4.0u"nm"   , 5.0u"nm"   , 6.0u"nm"   ) # Periodic cuboid
CubicBoundary(2.0u"nm"   , 2.0u"nm"   , Inf * u"nm") # Infinite boundary in z direction
CubicBoundary(Inf * u"nm", Inf * u"nm", Inf * u"nm") # Infinite boundary, no periodicity

RectangularBoundary(4.0u"nm", 5.0u"nm"   ) # Rectangle
RectangularBoundary(2.0u"nm", Inf * u"nm") # Infinite boundary in y direction

# Periodic triclinic from basis vectors
TriclinicBoundary(SVector(
    SVector(2.2      , 0.0      , 0.0      )u"nm",
    SVector(1.0      , 1.7320508, 0.0      )u"nm",
    SVector(1.37888  , 0.5399122, 1.0233204)u"nm",
))

# Periodic triclinic from basis vector lengths and angles α/β/γ
b = TriclinicBoundary(
    SVector(2.2, 2.0, 1.8)u"nm",
    deg2rad.(SVector(50.0, 40.0, 60.0)),
)

# Volume of bounding box
box_volume(b) # 3.8993746318188633 nm^3

# Random coordinate uniformly distributed within boundary
rand_coord(b) # SVector(2.651062310435411, 2.1702306804433973, 0.9518105403051831)u"nm"

# Wrap a coordinate back into the boundary if it is outside
wrap_coords(SVector(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)u"nm", b) # SVector(3.2, 1.0, 1.0)u"nm"
```

The [`box_center`](@ref), [`n_dimensions`](@ref), [`float_type`](@ref), [`place_atoms`](@ref) and [`place_diatomics`](@ref) functions are also available for boundaries.

The appropriate boundary to use will depend on your simulation.
For example, having different lengths in each dimension would usually only make sense in a situation where forces or restraints depended on the dimension.

## Simulators

Simulators define what type of simulation is run.
This could be anything from a simple energy minimization to complicated replica exchange MD.
The available simulators are:
- [`SteepestDescentMinimizer`](@ref)
- [`VelocityVerlet`](@ref)
- [`Verlet`](@ref)
- [`StormerVerlet`](@ref)
- [`Langevin`](@ref)
- [`LangevinSplitting`](@ref)
- [`TemperatureREMD`](@ref)
- [`HamiltonianREMD`](@ref)

The [`LangevinSplitting`](@ref) simulator can be used to define a variety of integrators such as velocity Verlet (splitting `"BAB"`), the Langevin implementation in [`Langevin`](@ref) (`"BAOA"`), and symplectic Euler integrators (`"AB"` and `"BA"`).

To define your own simulator, first define a `struct`:
```julia
struct MySimulator
    # Any properties, e.g. the time step or coupling methods
end
```
Then, define the function that carries out the simulation.
This example shows some of the helper functions you can use:
```julia
function Molly.simulate!(sys,
                            sim::MySimulator,
                            n_steps::Integer;
                            n_threads::Integer=Threads.nthreads())
    # Find neighbors like this
    neighbors = find_neighbors(sys, sys.neighbor_finder; n_threads=n_threads)
    run_loggers!(sys, neighbors, 0; n_threads=n_threads)

    for step_n in 1:n_steps
        # Calculate accelerations like this
        accels_t = accelerations(sys, neighbors; n_threads=n_threads)

        # Ensure coordinates stay within the simulation box like this
        sys.coords = wrap_coords.(sys.coords, (sys.boundary,))

        # Apply coupling like this
        apply_coupling!(sys, sim.coupling, sim)

        # Remove center of mass motion like this
        remove_CM_motion!(sys)

        # Apply the loggers like this
        run_loggers!(sys, neighbors, step_n; n_threads=n_threads)

        # Find new neighbors like this
        neighbors = find_neighbors(sys, sys.neighbor_finder, neighbors, step_n;
                                   n_threads=n_threads)
    end

    return sys
end
```
To use your custom simulator, give it as the second argument when calling [`simulate!`](@ref).

To define your own replica exchange simulator, first define a `struct`:
```julia
struct MyREMDSimulator
    dt # Time step
    exchange_time # Time between exchanges
    simulators # A list of simulators to use for each replica e.g. Langevin
    # Other properties of the simulation
end
```
Then, define the functions required for the simulation. This consists of first defining the function that carries out the exchange:
```julia
function my_exchange_fun!(sys::ReplicaSystem{D,G,T},
                        sim::MyREMDSimulator,
                        n::Integer,
                        m::Integer;
                        n_threads::Int=Threads.nthreads(),
                        rng=Random.GLOBAL_RNG) where {D,G,T}
    # Attempt to exchange the replicas with index n and m

    # First define Δ for the REMD scheme
    make_exchange = Δ <= 0 || rand(rng) < exp(-Δ)  # metroplis acceptance rate
    if make_exchange
        # exchange coordinates and velocities of replicas
        # also scale the velocities to match the temperature if required
    end

    return Δ, make_exchange
end
```

!!! tip "Correct Boltzman constant"
    To get the correct exchange rates, the units of the boltzmann constant must be corrected when used in the exchange 
    function:
    ```julia
    if dimension(sys.energy_units) == u"𝐋^2 * 𝐌 * 𝐍^-1 * 𝐓^-2"
        k_b = sys.k * T(Unitful.Na)
    else
        k_b = sys.k
    end
    ```

The above function returns `Δ` which is the argument of the acceptance rate that is logged by [`ReplicaExchangeLogger`](@ref)
and `make_exchange` which is a boolean indicating whether the exchange was successful.

Then, define a method for the `simulate!` function to perform the parallel simulation, it uses `Molly.simulate_remd!` for this
to which we pass our exchange function defined above:

```julia
function simulate!(sys::ReplicaSystem{D, G, T},
                    sim::MyREMDSimulator,
                    n_steps::Integer;
                    rng=Random.GLOBAL_RNG,
                    n_threads::Integer=Threads.nthreads()) where {D, G, T}

    # Do any initial setup if necessary
    
    Molly.simulate_remd!(sys, sim, n_steps, my_exchange_fun!; rng=rng, n_threads=n_threads)
end
```

Under the hood there are two implementations for the [`forces`](@ref) function used by [`accelerations`](@ref) and for [`potential_energy`](@ref): an in-place version geared towards CPUs and parallelism, and an out-of-place version geared towards GPUs and differentiable simulation.
You can define different versions of a simulator for in-place and out-of-place systems by dispatching on `System{D, false}` or `System{D, true}` respectively.
This also applies to coupling methods and neighbor lists.
You do not have to define two versions though: you may only intend to use the simulator one way, or the out-of-place version may be performant in all cases.

The implementation to use is guessed when you call [`System`](@ref) based on whether `coords` is a `CuArray` but can be given explicitly with the `gpu_diff_safe` keyword argument, for example if you want to run differentiable simulations on the CPU.
[`is_gpu_diff_safe`](@ref) will retrieve this property for a [`System`](@ref).

## Coupling

Temperature and pressure coupling allows properties to be controlled during a simulation.
The available couplers are:
- [`AndersenThermostat`](@ref)
- [`RescaleThermostat`](@ref)
- [`BerendsenThermostat`](@ref)

To define your own coupling method, first define the `struct`:
```julia
struct MyCoupler
    # Any properties, e.g. a target temperature or coupling constant
end
```
Then, define the function that implements the coupling every time step:
```julia
function apply_coupling!(sys, coupling::MyCoupler, sim)
    # Do something to the simulation, e.g. scale the velocities
    return sys
end
```
The functions [`velocity`](@ref), [`maxwell_boltzmann`](@ref) and [`temperature`](@ref) may be useful here.
To use your custom coupler, give it as the `coupling` argument to the simulator.

## Neighbor finders

Neighbor finders find close atoms periodically throughout the simulation, saving on computation time by allowing the force calculation between distant atoms to be omitted.
The available neighbor finders are:
- [`NoNeighborFinder`](@ref)
- [`CellListMapNeighborFinder`](@ref)
- [`TreeNeighborFinder`](@ref)
- [`DistanceNeighborFinder`](@ref)
- [`DistanceVecNeighborFinder`](@ref)

To define your own neighbor finder, first define the `struct`:
```julia
struct MyNeighborFinder
    nb_matrix::BitArray{2}
    matrix_14::BitArray{2}
    n_steps::Int
    # Any other properties, e.g. a distance cutoff
end
```
Examples of three useful properties are given here: a matrix indicating atom pairs eligible for non-bonded interactions, a matrix indicating atoms in a 1-4 bonding arrangement, and a value determining how many time steps occur between each evaluation of the neighbor finder.
Then, define the neighbor finding function that is called every step by the simulator:
```julia
function find_neighbors(s,
                        nf::MyNeighborFinder,
                        current_neighbors=nothing,
                        step_n::Integer=0;
                        n_threads::Integer=Threads.nthreads())
    if step_n % nf.n_steps == 0
        if isnothing(current_neighbors)
            neighbors = NeighborList()
        else
            neighbors = current_neighbors
        end
        empty!(neighbors)
        # Add to neighbors, for example
        push!(neighbors, (1, 2, false)) # atom i, atom j and whether they are in a 1-4 bonding arrangement
        return neighbors
    else
        return current_neighbors
    end
end
```
A different setup is used for the out-of-place implementation.
To use your custom neighbor finder, give it as the `neighbor_finder` argument when creating the [`System`](@ref).

## Loggers

Loggers record properties of the simulation to allow monitoring and analysis.
The available loggers are:
- [`GeneralObservableLogger`](@ref)
- [`TemperatureLogger`](@ref)
- [`CoordinateLogger`](@ref)
- [`VelocityLogger`](@ref)
- [`TotalEnergyLogger`](@ref)
- [`KineticEnergyLogger`](@ref)
- [`PotentialEnergyLogger`](@ref)
- [`ForceLogger`](@ref)
- [`StructureWriter`](@ref)
- [`TimeCorrelationLogger`](@ref)
- [`AutoCorrelationLogger`](@ref)
- [`AverageObservableLogger`](@ref)
- [`ReplicaExchangeLogger`](@ref)

Many of the loggers can be initialised with just the number of steps between recorded values, e.g. `CoordinateLogger(10)`.
An optional first argument is the type of the recorded value; the above is equivalent to `CoordinateLogger(typeof(1.0u"nm"), 10)` but if the simulation did not use units then `CoordinateLogger(Float64, 10)` would be required.
If the simulation is in 2D, giving `dims=2` as a keyword argument is required for some loggers.

To define your own logger, first define the `struct`:
```julia
struct MyLogger
    n_steps::Int
    # Any other properties, e.g. an Array to record values during the trajectory
end
```
Then, define the logging function that is called every step by the simulator:
```julia
function Molly.log_property!(logger::MyLogger, sys, neighbors, step_n; n_threads=Threads.nthreads())
    if step_n % logger.n_steps == 0
        # Record some property or carry out some action
    end
end
```
The use of `n_steps` is optional and is an example of how to record a property every n steps through the simulation.
To use your custom logger, add it to the named tuple of loggers given when creating the [`System`](@ref):
```julia
loggers = (mylogger=MyLogger(10),) # Don't forget the trailing comma!
```
In addition to being run at the end of each step, loggers are run before the first step, i.e. at step 0.
This means that a logger that records a value every step for a simulation with 100 steps will end up with 101 values.
Loggers are currently ignored for the purposes of taking gradients, so if a logger is used in the gradient calculation the gradients will appear to be nothing.

Many times, a logger will just record an observation to an `Array` containing a record of past observations.
For this purpose, you can use the [`GeneralObservableLogger`](@ref) construct without defining a custom logging function. Simply define your observation function as
```julia
function my_observable(sys::System, neighbors; n_threads::Integer)
    # Probe the system for some desired property
    return observation
end
```
A logger which records this property every `n_steps` can be constructed through 
```julia
my_logger = GeneralObservableLogger(my_observable, T, n_steps)
```
where `T = typeof(observation)` is the type of the return value for `my_observable`.
The logger's history can be accessed with `values(my_logger)`.
[`AverageObservableLogger`](@ref) is similar but records a running average rather than storing observations.

The [`TimeCorrelationLogger`](@ref) logger can be used to compute correlation functions of the form
```math
C(t) = \frac{\langle A_t \cdot B_0 \rangle}{\sqrt{\langle |A|^2 \rangle \langle |B|^2 \rangle}}
```
where *A* and *B* are scalar or vector centered observables and the brackets are ensemble averages.
This includes the computations of autocorrelation functions, which can be used to gather insight into the dynamical properties of the system, for instance using Green-Kubo formulas, or the statistical properties of a sampling method.

Let's look at a simple example, computing the velocity autocorrelation function for a simple system consisting of diatomic molecules defined by [`HarmonicBond`](@ref) potentials between pairs of atoms, and an additional [`SoftSphere`](@ref) potential between all pairs of atoms.
Let's start by defining the system.
```julia
n_atoms = 400
atom_mass = 10.0u"u"
atoms = [Atom(mass=atom_mass, σ=0.2u"nm", ϵ=0.2u"kJ * mol^-1") for i in 1:n_atoms]

# Initialization
boundary = SVector(6.0, 6.0, 6.0)u"nm"
coords = place_diatomics(n_atoms ÷ 2, boundary, 0.2u"nm"; min_dist=0.2u"nm")

temp = 50.0u"K"
velocities = [velocity(atom_mass, temp) .* 0.01 for i in 1:n_atoms]

# Interaction potentials
pairwise_inters = (SoftSphere(nl_only=true, cutoff=DistanceCutoff(0.6u"nm")),)

bonds = [HarmonicBond(k=10000u"kJ * mol^-1 * nm^-2", r0=0.2u"nm") for i in 1:(n_atoms ÷ 2)]
specific_inter_lists = (InteractionList2Atoms(
    collect(1:2:n_atoms),
    collect(2:2:n_atoms),
    repeat([""], length(bonds)),
    bonds,
),)

# Define system
nf = DistanceNeighborFinder(dist_cutoff=0.6u"nm", nb_matrix=trues(n_atoms, n_atoms))

sys = System(
    atoms=atoms,
    coords=coords,
    velocities=velocities,
    boundary=boundary,
    neighbor_finder=nf,
    pairwise_inters=pairwise_inters,
    specific_inter_lists=specific_inter_lists,
)
```

We leave the loggers empty until we thermalize the system using Langevin dynamics.
```julia
simulator = LangevinSplitting(
    dt=0.002u"ps",
    temperature=temp,
    friction=10.0u"u* ps^-1",
    splitting="BAOAB",
)
simulate!(sys, simulator, 10_000)
@show temperature(sys)
```
```console
temperature(sys) = 48.76795299825687 K
```
Good.
Next we define our correlation logger, add it to the system's loggers and run a long simulation.
Note that we need to redeclare the system when adding a logger.
```julia
# Velocity observable
# args and kwargs because more complex observables may require neighbors and parallelism
V(s::System, args...; kwargs...) = s.velocities
V_Type = eltype(sys.velocities)
logger = TimeCorrelationLogger(V, V, V_Type, V_Type, n_atoms, 1_000)

sys = System(
    atoms=atoms,
    coords=sys.coords,
    velocities=sys.velocities,
    boundary=boundary,
    neighbor_finder=nf,
    pairwise_inters=pairwise_inters,
    specific_inter_lists=specific_inter_lists,
    loggers=(velocity_autocorrelation=logger,)
)
simulate!(sys, simulator, 100_000)
```

Check the output:
```julia
show(sys.loggers)
```
```console
(velocity_autocorrelation = AutoCorrelationLogger with n_correlation 1000 and 100001 samples collected for observable V,)
```
Note we also could have used the convenience function [`AutoCorrelationLogger`](@ref) to define our logger since the two observables we are correlating are the same.
```julia
using Plots, UnitfulRecipes

t_range = (0:999) * u"ps"
plot(
    t_range,
    values(sys.loggers.velocity_autocorrelation),
    xlabel="time",
    ylabel="correlation",
    label="C(t)",
)
```

As expected, the velocities are highly correlated at small time offsets and the correlation decays rapidly.
The oscillatory behavior is due to the contribution of the harmonic bond interactions.

## Analysis

Molly contains some tools for analysing the results of simulations.
The available analysis functions are:
- [`visualize`](@ref)
- [`rdf`](@ref)
- [`distances`](@ref)
- [`displacements`](@ref)
- [`velocity_autocorr`](@ref)
- [`rmsd`](@ref)
- [`radius_gyration`](@ref)

Julia is a language well-suited to implementing all kinds of analysis for molecular simulations.
