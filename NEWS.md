## v0.22.0 - Feb 2025

The package is rewritten to use Enzyme.jl rather than Zygote.jl for differentiable simulations. This allows mutating code to be used, leading to better performance on CPU and GPU. In addition, faster CUDA kernels are added and support for other GPU backends is added via KernelAbstractions.jl.

### Breaking changes
- `CoordinateLogger`, `VelocityLogger` and `ForceLogger` are renamed to `CoordinatesLogger`, `VelocitiesLogger` and `ForcesLogger` respectively for consistency.
- During system setup the `gpu` keyword argument is replaced by `array_type`, with `CuArray` giving the same behaviour as before. Use of other array types such as `ROCArray` is supported. The `use_cell_list` keyword argument is replaced with `neighbor_finder_type`, with the default depending on the backend.
- The second type parameter to `System` is changed from a `Bool` indicating whether the system is on the GPU to the array type of the system.
- Giving the `force_units` and `energy_units` is no longer required when constructing pairwise interactions such as `LennardJones`. In addition, mixing functions and shortcut functions can now be given to determine how to combine atomic parameters and when to skip the interaction respectively.
- The arguments to `force` and `potential_energy` for pairwise and specific interactions are changed to allow more flexible interaction definitions, depending for example on the velocities or step number.
- Differentiable simulations are no longer compatible with Zygote.jl, but can now be carried out using Enzyme.jl. This is faster and more memory-efficient.
- The `solute` field to `Atom` is removed and the `atom_type` field is added. `weight_solute_solvent` is no longer an option for `LennardJones`, though similar functionality is available with `atom_type` and mixing functions.
- `box_volume` is renamed to `volume`.
- `run_loggers!` is renamed to `apply_loggers!` to avoid confusion with the `run_loggers` function argument.
- The abstract types `PairwiseInteraction` and `SpecificInteraction` are removed. Custom interactions no longer need to sub-type anything.
- Extensions are added for code requiring Enzyme.jl, CUDA.jl and KernelDensity.jl, so relevant imports are now required before using those features.

### Non-breaking changes
- Support for Julia versions before 1.10 is dropped.

### New features
- Backends supported by KernelAbstractions.jl can be used to run simulations by using the appropriate array type or the `array_type` keyword argument during system setup.
- The Berendsen pressure coupling method is added as `BerendsenBarostat`.
- The `density` and `dipole_moment` functions are added.
- The `AshbaughHatch` and `Yukawa` potentials are added.
- `VolumeLogger` and `DensityLogger` are added.
- The `rng` keyword argument is added to `place_atoms`, `place_diatomics` and `random_coord`, allowing reproducible coordinate generation.
- The `array_type` function is added, giving the array type of a system or array.
- The step number can be given as a third argument with a default of `0` to `forces`, `potential_energy` and `virial` acting on a system. This allows time-dependent forces, with the caveat that the step number resets to 1 every time `simulate!` is called and can also be 0 to calculate forces before the first step.
- A method is added to `random_velocities!` which takes in and modifies the velocities as the first argument.

### Performance improvements
- Better CUDA force and potential energy kernels significantly improve performance on CUDA compatible devices. The `GPUNeighborFinder` is added for this path but does not calculate neighbors, which are calculated each step in the kernels.
- Simulations are faster on both CPU and GPU due to mutating code leading to fewer memory allocations.
- System setup from a file is made much faster.
- The package is faster to load as a number of dependencies have been removed.
- The performance of implicit solvent on CPU is improved.

### Bug fixes

### Non-breaking changes
- Support for Julia versions before 1.9 is dropped. A package extension, rather than Requires.jl, is used to provide `visualize` when GLMakie.jl is imported.

### New features
- `ASECalculator` is added, allowing Python ASE calculators to be used in Molly. The code is in a package extension available when PythonCall.jl is imported. It is the user's responsibility to have the required Python packages installed. Examples of using MACE and psi4 are given.
- `current_forces` and `current_potential_energy` can be used in logging functions to reuse properties calculated in the simulation step. They default to `nothing` when the properties are not available.
- Interaction types are allowed to be different for each replica in a `ReplicaSystem`.

### Performance improvements
- `PotentialEnergyLogger`, `TotalEnergyLogger` and `ForceLogger` avoid recomputation when the relevant properties are calculated in the simulation step.

### Bug fixes
- `MollyCalculator` now works in two dimensions and for other floating point types.

## v0.20.0 - Mar 2024

### Breaking changes
- `apply_constraints!` and `SHAKE` are removed as part of the changes to constraints.
- The `System` constructor for AtomsBase.jl systems is changed to take `force_units` and `energy_units` as keyword arguments rather than positional arguments. The defaults are consistent with the rest of Molly.
- `velocity_autocorr` is removed since `AutoCorrelationLogger` provides a more general version of this functionality.

### New features
- Support for constraints is improved and documented with `SHAKE_RATTLE` allowing the SHAKE and RATTLE algorithms to be applied as appropriate to most simulators. `DistanceConstraint`, `disable_constrained_interactions!`, `apply_position_constraints!`, `apply_velocity_constraints!`, `check_position_constraints` and `check_velocity_constraints` are all added. Constraints are not currently compatible with GPU simulation.
- Gradients with respect to the boundary can now be calculated in some contexts.

- The type parameters of `System` and `ReplicaSystem` are changed.

### New features
- `forces`, `accelerations`, `potential_energy`, `total_energy`, `virial` and `pressure` now calculate the neighbors by default when called without neighbors. If they are being reused, neighbors should be pre-computed as before for performance.
- `System` and `ReplicaSystem` now have a `data` field, set with the `data` keyword argument to the constructors, that can be used to store arbitrary data. This data can be accessed inside simulators.
- `LennardJonesSoftCore`, `CoulombSoftCore` and custom atom types are now compatible with gradients.

The options are `true`, `false` or `:skipzero`, in which case the loggers are not run before the first step. `run_loggers` is `true` by default except for `SteepestDescentMinimizer`, where it is `false`. `run_loggers!` now has a fourth argument which determines whether the loggers are run, default `true`.
- The scale factor given to `scale_coords!` can now be a `SVector` corresponding to the scaling factor for each axis in addition to a single number.
- General interactions can now implement a method for `virial`.

Setting one or more values to `Inf` gives no boundary in that dimension. `RectangularBoundary` should be used for 2D simulations. `float_type`, `box_volume` and `AtomsBase.n_dimensions` are defined for boundaries.
- The recorded values in loggers are now accessed with `Base.values`. Loggers are now given to the `System` as a named tuple rather than as a `Dict` for performance reasons.

- `Simulation` is renamed to `System` and the time step and coupling are passed to the simulator, which is passed to the `simulate!` function.
- `System` is a sub-type of `AbstractSystem` from AtomsBase.jl and the relevant interface is implemented, allowing interoperability with the wider ecosystem.
- Specific interactions are changed to store indices and parameters as part of types such as `InteractionList2Atoms`. Specific interaction force functions now return types such as `SpecificForce4Atoms`. Specific interactions can now run on the GPU.
- Some abstract types are removed. `NeighborFinder` is renamed to `AbstractNeighborFinder`.
- The `potential_energy` function arguments match the `force` function arguments.
- File reader setup functions are called using `System` and return a `System` directly.
- `find_neighbors!` is renamed to `find_neighbors` and returns the neighbors, which are no longer stored as part of the simulation.
- `VelocityFreeVerlet` is renamed to `StormerVerlet`.
- `RescaleThermostat` and `BerendsenThermostat` are added.
- `random_velocities!` and `velocity_autocorr` are added.
- `VelocityLogger`, `KineticEnergyLogger` and `PotentialEnergyLogger` are added.
- `DistanceVecNeighborFinder` is added for use on the GPU.
- Atomic charges are now dimensionless, i.e 1.0 is an atomic charge of +1.
- `HarmonicAngle` now works in 2D.
- Support for Julia versions before 1.7 is dropped.

## v0.5.0 - Oct 2021

- Readers are added for OpenMM XML force field files and coordinate files supported by Chemfiles.jl. Forces, energies and the results of a short simulation exactly match the OpenMM reference implementation for a standard protein in the a99SB-ILDN force field.
- A cell neighbor list is added using CellListMap.jl.
- `CoulombReactionField` is added to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions.
- The `PeriodicTorsion` interaction is added and the previous Ryckaert-Bellemans `Torsion` is renamed to `RBTorsion`.
- Support for weighting non-bonded interactions between atoms in a 1-4 interaction is added.
- The box size is changed from one value to three, allowing a larger variety of periodic box shapes.
- Support for different mixing rules is added for the Lennard-Jones interaction, with the default being Lorentz-Bertelot mixing.
- A simple `DistanceCutoff` is added.
- Excluded residue names can now be defined for a `StructureWriter`.
- The `placediatomics` and `ustripvec` functions are added.
- The `AtomMin` type is removed, with `Atom` now being a bits type and `AtomData` used to store atom data.
- Visualisation now uses GLMakie.jl.
- `adjust_bounds` is renamed to `wrapcoords`.

## v0.4.0 - Sep 2021

- Unitful.jl support is added and recommended for use, meaning numbers have physical meaning and many errors are caught. More type parameters have been added to various types to allow this. It is still possible to run simulations without units by specifying the `force_unit` and `energy_unit` arguments to `Simulation`.
- Interaction constructors with keyword arguments are added or improved.
- The maximum force for non-bonded interactions is removed.

## v0.3.0 - May 2021

- The spelling of "neighbour" is changed to "neighbor" throughout the package. This affects `NoNeighborFinder`, `DistanceNeighborFinder`, `TreeNeighborFinder`, `find_neighbors!` and the `neighbor_finder` argument to `Simulation`.
- Torsion angle force calculation is improved.
- A bug in force calculation for specific interactions is fixed.
- Support for Julia versions before 1.6 is dropped.

## v0.2.2 - Feb 2021

- The `TreeNeighbourFinder` is added for faster distance neighbour finding using NearestNeighbors.jl.

## v0.2.1 - Dec 2020

- Documentation is added for cutoffs.
- Compatibility bounds are updated for various packages, including requiring CUDA.jl version 2.
- Support for Julia versions before 1.5 is dropped.

## v0.2.0 - Sep 2020

- Shifted potential and shifted force cutoff approaches for non-bonded interactions are introduced.
- An `EnergyLogger` is added and the potential energy for existing interactions defined.
- Simulations can now be run with the `CuArray` type from CUDA.jl, allowing GPU acceleration.
- The in-place `force!` functions are changed to out-of-place `force` functions with different arguments.
- The i-i self-interaction is no longer computed for `force` functions.
- The Mie potential is added.
- The list of neighbours is now stored in the `Simulation` type.
- Documentation is added for experimental differentiable molecular simulation.
- Optimisations are implemented throughout the package.
- Support for Julia versions before 1.3 is dropped.

## v0.1.0 - Jun 2020

Initial release of Molly.jl, a Julia package for molecular simulation.

Features:
- Interface to allow definition of new forces, simulators, thermostats, neighbour finders, loggers etc.
- Read in pre-computed Gromacs topology and coordinate files with the OPLS-AA forcefield and run MD on proteins with given parameters. In theory it can do this for any regular protein, but in practice this is untested.
- Non-bonded interactions - Lennard-Jones Van der Waals/repulsion force, electrostatic Coulomb potential, gravitational potential, soft sphere potential.
- Bonded interactions - covalent bonds, bond angles, torsion angles.
- Andersen thermostat.
- Velocity Verlet and velocity-free Verlet integration.
- Explicit solvent.
- Periodic boundary conditions in a cubic box.
- Neighbour list to speed up calculation of non-bonded forces.
- Automatic multithreading.
- Some analysis functions, e.g. RDF.
- Run with Float64 or Float32.
- Physical agent-based modelling.
- Visualise simulations as animations.
